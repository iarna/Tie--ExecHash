=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Tie::ExecHash;

  my %foo = ();
  tie( %foo, 'Tie::ExecHash');

  $foo{'bar'} = 1;
  print "$foo{'bar'}\n"; # 1

  my $baz = "red";

  $foo{'bar'} = [ sub { $baz = $_[0] }, sub { $baz } ];

  print "$foo{'bar'}\n"; # red

  $foo{'bar'} = "a suffusion of yellow";

  print "$baz\n"; # a suffusion of yellow

=head1 DESCRIPTION

What this does is allow you to have some hash values act like they are tied
scalars without actually having to go through the trouble of making them
really be tied scalars.

By default the tied hash works exactly like a normal hash.  Its behavior
changes when you assign a value of an arrayref with exactly two code blocks
in it.  When you do this it uses the first as the get routine and the second
as the set routine.  Any future gets or sets to this key will be mediated
via these subroutines.
